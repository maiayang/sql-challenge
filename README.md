# sql-challenge

In this challenge, we used what we learned about SQL queries to analyze  a company's employee information from the 1980's and 1990's. 

We were given six tables containing the employee information. First we designed an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD. Special attention was paid to indicate primary keys and foreign keys. Then we created the tables in pgAdmin4. Next we imported the data into the tables.

For the analysis, we performed 'Joins' to combine the relevent data from the tables and filtered them using 'Where" statements.
